    <p>Hi, my name is Jolie (she/hers)</p>
    <p>
      I started studying digital media because I wanted to learn more about
      graphic design, but unfortunately, there is not. So here I am diving into
      UI/UX and film making!
    </p>
    <p>
      I spend a lot of time editing videos, which are vlogging and stuff !!!
    </p>
    <p>
      My favourite emoji is the crying face ðŸ˜­ as it expresses all sorts of
      emotions, either happy or sad
    </p>
    <p>
      My personal experience with sound is enjoying the sound system while
      playing games (especially candy crush saga!!) I did a little bit in Reaper
      but it demanded my quite amount of time to get through it - it was a fun
      time.<!-- elaborate as much as you like -->
    </p>
    <p>
      I have some prior experience working with code like basic HTML, CSS, and
      Javascript with my Interactive Media class last semester !!! It paves my
      way into pursuing web design. I had a super good time ðŸ˜­<!-- elaborate as much as you like -->
